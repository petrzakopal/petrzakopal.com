To create something new is very hard. When creating the website I was inspired by the beautiful design of websites by amazing designers and engineers from X (formerly Twitter), such as.

I did not mean to copy, just to get inspired and incorporate some aspects of the designs into my own. My main job is not a designer nor web developer, so I inspire everwhere I can to do this side job as well as I can. The website will be updated, changed and iterated over time.
